# Londi the Dreaming Girl

![Londi stands on the grass looking up at the clouds.]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

Londi was a dreaming girl. Up in the sky, she didn’t see clouds.

![The clouds are shaped like geese and fish and sheep.]({{ page.images-folder }}/02.jpg)

Instead Londi saw flying geese, jumping fish, and fluffy sheep running home.

![Londi lies on the grass. Gogo comes outside.]({{ page.images-folder }}/03.jpg)

One afternoon, Gogo came outside, looking tired.

“Londi, stop dreaming!” she said. “It’s time to go and fetch the water.”

![Londi's feet]({{ page.images-folder }}/04.jpg)

Londi stood up and smiled at her feet.

“Let’s go, feet! You know the way there!”

![Londi walks to the tap carrying her bucket.]({{ page.images-folder }}/05.jpg)

Londi started walking to the tap. She hopped over the rocks.

She crept past Mama Neli’s house. She dashed down the path.

![Londi stands behind others in the queue for the tap. ]({{ page.images-folder }}/06.jpg)

The line at the tap was long. “Oh no!” Londi said to her feet. 

“We’ll have to wait. Let’s stay in line. No dreaming away!”

![There is a shiny purple shoe in the bush.]({{ page.images-folder }}/07.jpg)

Ooh! Londi thought. But what’s that shining over there? 

I wonder who lost their shoe?

![Londi dreams of a girl wearing only one purple shoe. She also dreams of a pig wearing three purple shoes.]({{ page.images-folder }}/08.jpg)

Did it belong to a girl like me? 

Or something else...

![Londi crouches down next to a yellow bird and her chicks.]({{ page.images-folder }}/09.jpg)

And what’s that under there?

Cheep! Cheep!

![Gogo stands with her hands on her hips. She has a big shadow.]({{ page.images-folder }}/10.jpg)

And what’s that big shadow? Uh oh, it’s Gogo!

“Londi, your bucket nearly rolled away!”

“Sorry, Gogo. I dreamed too far, again.”

![The setting sun smiles. Londi watches. Gogo carries the bucket home.]({{ page.images-folder }}/11.jpg)

They filled up the bucket together. Londi watched the big sun sink into the hills.

“Come let’s go, my dreaming girl,” said Gogo.

![Londi looks up and sees a pink pig in the sky.]({{ page.images-folder }}/12.jpg)

“Look, Gogo! There’s a pink pig in the sky!”

“Oh Londi... It’s just a cloud,” Gogo sighed.

Londi took Gogo’s hand and they walked home together happily.
