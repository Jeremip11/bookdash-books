# I Will Help You

![Mama Heron is tangled in barbed wire in the river. Her chicks are far away in their nest.]({{ site.image-set }}/01.jpg)

“Ouch!” Mama Heron hurts her wing and leg on barbed wire.

![A taxi drives past the river. It doesn't stop. Mama Heron calls out to a bus, which also doesn't stop. A boy cycles past but doesn't stop either.]({{ site.image-set }}/02.jpg)

“I am hurt. I can’t get home to my children.”

“Please help me.”

![Lungile walks along the river bank with his push car. He asks Mama Heron why she is crying.]({{ site.image-set }}/03.jpg)

“Why are you crying Mama Heron?”

“I can’t get home to my children.”

![Lungile pushes Mama Heron  in his push car.]({{ site.image-set }}/04.jpg)

“I will help you,” says Lungile.

![Lungile kneels beside the car and talks to Mama Heron.]({{ site.image-set }}/05.jpg)

“Thank you, Lungile!”

![Gogo hands Lungile some coins. Afterwards he swims in the river with his friends.]({{ site.image-set }}/06.jpg)

The next day, Gogo sends Lungile to the shop to buy bread. 

On the way, he stops to play with his friends in the river.

![Lungile stands with his friends and turns out his pockets. They are empty. He walks away. He is very sad.]({{ site.image-set }}/07.jpg)

Eish! The money is gone.

![Gogo is cross! She has her hand on her hip and she shouts at Lungile.]({{ site.image-set }}/08.jpg)

“Don’t come home until you find that money!”

![Lungile sits on the river bank and cries. Mama Heron flies towards him.]({{ site.image-set }}/09.jpg)

“Why are you crying, Lungile?”

![Still crying, Lungile tells Mama Heron what has happened.]({{ site.image-set }}/10.jpg)

“I lost the money Gogo gave me to buy bread. We have no supper now.”

“I will help you.”

![Mama Heron looks into the water. Lungile is excited.]({{ site.image-set }}/11.jpg)

Mama Heron’s sharp eyes see the coins shining in the water.

![Lungile hugs Mama Heron.]({{ site.image-set }}/12.jpg)

“Thank you, Mama Heron.”
