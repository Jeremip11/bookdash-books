# Book Dash books

This is a Jekyll setup for turning markdown version of Book Dash books into HTML for web and ebooks.

## Tips

* This assumes you're using kramdown as your markdown engine.
* Poetry: You want HTML that puts each verse in a paragraph, with line breaks between lines. Add two spaces at the end of each line so that the poetry reads easily in markdown, but the HTML will have a `<br />` at the end of each line.
