# Book Dash books

We're creating simple HTML versions of [Book Dash](http://bookdash.org) books for the web and ebooks. 

We're using the [Electric Book Workflow](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book-workflow) for this. To get the finished HTML, see [the website version of these files](http://bookdash.github.io/bookdash-books/).
