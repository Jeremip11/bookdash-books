# Walking Together

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

When we go walking and the road is long, we’ll walk together singing a song.

 I am with you and you are with me. 
 
 A journey is fun with our family.

I’ll keep you cosy like a mother hen. 

She keeps her chicks warm under her wing.

If the rain starts to fall down from the sky, like that good hat I’ll keep your face dry.

If storm clouds get angry and grumble and moan, be brave, why cry? 

You’re not alone.

We’re walking together so we never get bored. 

Look up! Look around!  

See where we’ve explored!

If you see something that’s funny to see, I don’t want to miss it. 

Please share it with me!

If your feet start to hurt from the distance we’ve passed, don’t worry, we’ve made it! 

Here’s the clinic at last.

We all need to check our throat, lungs and ears. 

Get strong as you grow, it’s no reason for tears.

Do you think it’s scary? 

Here, hold my hand. 

She’ll check your blood pressure with this clever armband.

They give us our medicine, tell us what we should know, to keep us all healthy. 

Now back home we go.

It’s okay to be tired, there’s so much we’ve seen. 

Now it’s your bedtime. 

Sleep well and sweet dreams.
