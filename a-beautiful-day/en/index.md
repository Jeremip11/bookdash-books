# A Beautiful Day

![Mom and baby greet Nicholas as he stretches in bed.]({{ site.image-set }}/01.jpg)

“What a beautiful day,” says Mom. “Wake up Nicholas.”

“Hello sun,” says Nicholas. “Good morning birds.”


![Dad and Nicholas sit at the breakfast table. Nicholas waves to his friend Jacob through the kitchen window.]({{ site.image-set }}/02.jpg)

“It’s a lovely day,” says Dad. “Let’s have a picnic by the river.”

“Can my friend Jacob come?” asks Nicholas.


![The animals jump up and down with excitement. Nicholas and Jacob put their arms around each other.]({{ site.image-set }}/03.jpg)

“Don’t forget me. I love picnics!” says Donkey. 

“And me. I want to come too!” says Dog. 

“Follow us,” say the birds.


![Dad carries a picnic basket on his head. Mom, the children and all the animals follow him to the picnic spot.]({{ site.image-set }}/04.jpg)

“I’ll race you to that tree,” Nicholas says.


![At the tree, Nicholas bends over panting.]({{ site.image-set }}/06.jpg)

“I won, I won,” says Donkey. 

“Not fair,” says Nicholas. “You’ve got four legs.”

![Nicholas does a handstand. Jacob does a handstand on one hand.]({{ site.image-set }}/07.jpg)

“Look what I can do,” says Nicholas. 

“I bet you can’t do this,” says Jacob.

“Here’s our picnic spot,” says Dad.

“Race you to the water!” says Jacob.

“Come and eat, boys and girls,” says Mom.

“Time to go home,” says Mom.“Say goodbye to Jacob.”
