# Is There Anyone Like Me?

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

I wonder if there’s another me somewhere in the world.

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/02.jpg)

Who looks the same.

And talks the same.

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/03.jpg)

And even has my curls.

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/04.jpg)

Someone with my eyes my ears. 

Who even has my laugh.

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/05.jpg)

Who can do what I can do ...

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/06.jpg)

... and can’t do what I can’t.

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/07.jpg)

I’ve looked and looked everywhere to find another me.

I went down to the park and looked behind the trees.

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/08.jpg)

I looked around, up and down ...

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/09.jpg)

... at every single face.

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/10.jpg)

I couldn’t find another me in any single place.

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/11.jpg)

There’s only one me in the world!I’m special, oh it’s true!

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/12.jpg)

But not just me, don’t you see?There’s only one of you!
