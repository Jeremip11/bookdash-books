<p>One day, Mr Sloth came to visit. He said:<br />
I’m sleepy! I need a good branch for a bed!</p>

<p class="page-break-after"><img src="images/1.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth is sleepy and yawning" /></p>

<p>I’m quite good at climbing. I know how to swing.<br />
But sleeping’s my favourite, favourite thing!</p>

<p class="page-break-after"><img src="images/2.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth starts climbing the tree" /></p>

<p>This branch looks lovely! I think I’ll sleep here.<br />
And you? Don’t you think that’s a splendid idea?</p>

<p class="page-break-after"><img src="images/3.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth spots a branch. Is that a big ear nearby?" /></p>

<p>Oh no, Mr Sloth! A giraffe’s eating there!<br />
He might think you’re lunch and start nibbling your hair!</p>

<p class="page-break-after"><img src="images/4.jpg" alt="A giraffe bites Mr Sloth by mistake!" /></p>

<p>This branch looks lovely! I think I’ll sleep here.<br />
And you? Don’t you think that’s a splendid idea?</p>

<p class="page-break-after"><img src="images/5.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth spots a branch. There are a few bees flying around." /></p>

<p>Oh no, Mr Sloth! There’s a beehive right there!<br />
You’ll never get sleep with those bees everywhere!</p>

<p class="page-break-after"><img src="images/6.jpg" alt="Bees fly out of a beehive around Mr Sloth!" /></p>

<p>This branch looks lovely! I think I’ll sleep here.<br />
And you? Don’t you think that’s a splendid idea?</p>

<p class="page-break-after"><img src="images/7.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth spots a branch. There is a tail nearby." /></p>

<p>Oh no, Mr Sloth, that’s a snake over there!<br />
Not a branch! Poor old snake. You gave him quite a scare.</p>

<p class="page-break-after"><img src="images/8.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth grabs snake by mistake!" /></p>

<p>This branch looks lovely! I think I’ll sleep here.<br />
And you? Don’t you think that’s a splendid idea?</p>

<p class="page-break-after"><img src="images/9.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth spots and branch. There are feet nearby." /></p>

<p>Oh no, Mr Sloth! There’s a bird squawking there!<br />
You’ll never get sleep with that noise in the air!</p>

<p class="page-break-after"><img src="images/10.jpg" alt="A hadeda is squawking loudly there!" /></p>

<p>Try climb one more branch, Mr Sloth! they all said.<br />
And that branch was just the right one for his bed.</p>

<p class="page-break-after"><img src="images/11.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth climbs to the top of the tree and smiles." /></p>

<p>The bird and the snake, the giraffe and each bee<br />
were happy to have Mr Sloth in their tree.</p>

<p class="page-break-after"><img src="images/12.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth and the animals are all sleeping nicely in the tree together." /></p>
