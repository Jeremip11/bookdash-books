# What if...?

![A little girl sits outside on the steps of her house. She is dreaming.]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

Nandi sat on the blue steps of her house.

![There are dream bubbles, birds and coloured shapes all over.]({{ page.images-folder }}/02.jpg)

She was wondering...

![Nandi leaps high above her house.]({{ page.images-folder }}/03.jpg)

What if jelly beans made you jump really high? 

You could get to school in one big leap!

![Nandi talks to two chickens and a goat.]({{ page.images-folder }}/04.jpg)

What if goats and chickens could talk?

Would they tell good jokes?

![Nandi blasts off in a rocket ship.]({{ page.images-folder }}/05.jpg)

What if houses were rocket ships? 

Your family could go on holidays to the moon!

![Nandi sits at the table holding a knife and fork. There is a hamburger on the table.]({{ page.images-folder }}/06.jpg)

What if no one had to cook? What if supper just arrived on the table?

(And it was always your favourite.)

![Nandi eats an ice lolly.]({{ page.images-folder }}/07.jpg)

What if ice-lollies never melted? 

They could last all summer.

![Tigers, elephants, books and their characters swirl around Nandi's head.]({{ page.images-folder }}/08.jpg)

What if the pictures in books flew around your head when Dad read to you?

![Nandi wears pink gum boots and runs very fast.]({{ page.images-folder }}/09.jpg)

What if my pink gumboots were magical? 

I could run faster than my big brother!

![Nandi squeezes her eyes shut.]({{ page.images-folder }}/10.jpg)

What if you squeezed your eyes shut and...

![Nandi sits outside on the steps of her house. She is still dreaming. Her brother stands behind her.]({{ page.images-folder }}/11.jpg)

“Nandi, what are you doing?” asked Nandi’s big brother. 

Nandi sat back on the step with a big smile on her face. 

![Nandi smiles.]({{ page.images-folder }}/12.jpg)

“Just wondering,” she said.
