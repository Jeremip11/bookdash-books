# A Beautiful Day

![Mom and baby greet Nicholas as he stretches in bed.]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

“What a beautiful day,” says Mom. “Wake up Nicholas.”

“Hello sun,” says Nicholas. “Good morning birds.”


![Dad and Nicholas sit at the breakfast table. Nicholas waves to his friend Jacob through the kitchen window.]({{ page.images-folder }}/02.jpg)

“It’s a lovely day,” says Dad. “Let’s have a picnic by the river.”

“Can my friend Jacob come?” asks Nicholas.


![The animals jump up and down with excitement. Nicholas and Jacob put their arms around each other.]({{ page.images-folder }}/03.jpg)

“Don’t forget me. I love picnics!” says Donkey. 

“And me. I want to come too!” says Dog. 

“Follow us,” say the birds.

“I’ll race you to that tree,” Nicholas says.


![At the tree, Nicholas bends over panting.]({{ page.images-folder }}/06.jpg)

“I won, I won,” says Donkey. 

“Not fair,” says Nicholas. “You’ve got four legs.”

“Look what I can do,” says Nicholas. 

“I bet you can’t do this,” says Jacob.

“Here’s our picnic spot,” says Dad.

“Race you to the water!” says Jacob.
