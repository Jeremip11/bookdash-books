<h1 id="sleepy-mr-sloth">Sleepy Mr Sloth</h1>

<p><img src="images/01.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth is sleepy and yawning." /></p>

<p>One day, Mr Sloth came to visit. He said:</p>

<p>I’m sleepy! I need a good branch for a bed!</p>

<p><img src="images/02.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth starts climbing the tree." /></p>

<p>I’m quite good at climbing. I know how to swing.</p>

<p>But sleeping’s my favourite, favourite thing!</p>

<p><img src="images/03.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth spots a branch. Is that a big ear nearby?" /></p>

<p>This branch looks lovely! I think I’ll sleep here.</p>

<p>And you? Don’t you think that’s a splendid idea?</p>

<p><img src="images/04.jpg" alt="A giraffe bites Mr Sloth by mistake!" /></p>

<p>Oh no, Mr Sloth! A giraffe’s eating there!</p>

<p>He might think you’re lunch and start nibbling your hair!</p>

<p><img src="images/05.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth spots a branch. There are a few bees flying around." /></p>

<p>This branch looks lovely! I think I’ll sleep here.</p>

<p>And you? Don’t you think that’s a splendid idea?</p>

<p><img src="images/06.jpg" alt="Bees fly out of a beehive around Mr Sloth!" /></p>

<p>Oh no, Mr Sloth! There’s a beehive right there!</p>

<p>You’ll never get sleep with those bees everywhere!</p>

<p><img src="images/07.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth spots a branch. There is a tail nearby." /></p>

<p>This branch looks lovely! I think I’ll sleep here.</p>

<p>And you? Don’t you think that’s a splendid idea?</p>

<p><img src="images/08.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth grabs snake by mistake!" /></p>

<p>Oh no, Mr Sloth, that’s a snake over there!</p>

<p>Not a branch! Poor old snake. You gave him quite a scare.</p>

<p><img src="images/09.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth spots a branch. There are feet nearby." /></p>

<p>This branch looks lovely! I think I’ll sleep here.</p>

<p>And you? Don’t you think that’s a splendid idea?</p>

<p><img src="images/10.jpg" alt="A hadeda is squawking loudly there!" /></p>

<p>Oh no, Mr Sloth! There’s a bird squawking there!</p>

<p>You’ll never get sleep with that noise in the air!</p>

<p><img src="images/11.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth climbs to the top of the tree and smiles." /></p>

<p>Try climb one more branch, Mr Sloth! they all said.</p>

<p>And that branch was just the right one for his bed.</p>

<p><img src="images/12.jpg" alt="Mr Sloth and the animals are all sleeping nicely in the tree together." /></p>

<p>The bird and the snake, the giraffe and each bee</p>

<p>were happy to have Mr Sloth in their tree.</p>
