What is it?

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/02.jpg)

What is it? It hasn't got a trunk. It's not like me.

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/03.jpg)

What is it? It hasn’t got a tail. It’s not like me.

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/04.jpg)

What is it? Ugh! Where are its feathers? It’s not like me.

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/05.jpg)

What is it? Look at those tiny feet. It’s not like us.

Do you think it’s dangerous?

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/07.jpg)

Do you think it wants to eat us?

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/08.jpg)

Achoo! Achoo!

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/09.jpg)

It's chasing us!

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/11.jpg)

Be careful. Come back.

What is it? 

It's a baby, just like me!
