# Rafiki’s Style

![Rafiki watches soccer on TV with his aunt and uncle. The soccer player wears a red and yellow soccer shirt. His hair is stripey like a zebra.]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

On Sunday, Jimmy Zogba scored the winning goal.

On Monday, the Cool Cat Crew strutted by.

![One of the Cool Cat Crew points to his zebra hair. Rafiki looks glum.]({{ page.images-folder }}/03.jpg)

“Hey, Rafiki, where’s your zebra hair? Your hair’s so plain, like you don’t care.”

![Another member of the Cool Cat Crew shows Rafiki the fake tatoo of a soccer ball on his arm.]({{ page.images-folder }}/04.jpg)

“Hey, Rafiki, where’s your fake tattoo? Your skin’s so boring. You are too.”

![The third member of the gang points to his gold teeth. Rafiki touches his own teeth.]({{ page.images-folder }}/05.jpg)

“Hey, Rafiki, where’s your bling? Your teeth are wonky, that’s the thing.”

![Rafiki walks on the pavement, head hung low.]({{ page.images-folder }}/06.jpg)

That day, Rafiki walked home slowly.

![Rafiki's aunt prepares to cut his hair.]({{ page.images-folder }}/07.jpg)

“Auntie, can I have zebra hair?”

“I can’t cut you zebra hair. Actually, I wouldn’t dare.”

![Rafiki's sister sits and draws. Rafiki asks her to draw him a tattoo.]({{ page.images-folder }}/08.jpg)

“My skin’s so boring, Sisi. Can you make a fake tattoo?”

“You don’t need one to look like you.”

![Rafiki talks to his uncle while his uncle fixes a car.]({{ page.images-folder }}/09.jpg)

“Mkhulu, I wish I had some bling.”“Bling, my child, don’t mean a thing.”

![Rafiki watches soccer on TV with his aunt and uncle. The soccer player wears a white shirt and his hair is shaved like Rafiki's.]({{ page.images-folder }}/10.jpg)

The next weekend, Santi Ramires scored the winning goal.

![Rafiki wears his usual white shirt. The Cool Cat Crew wear white soccer shirts. Their hair is now shaved.]({{ page.images-folder }}/11.jpg)

On Monday, the Cool Cat Crew strutted by.

“Hey, Rafiki! Looking fine!”

![Rafiki stands with his aunt and uncle and sister. He shrugs.]({{ page.images-folder }}/12.jpg)

Rafiki shrugged. “I look like me; this style is mine.”
