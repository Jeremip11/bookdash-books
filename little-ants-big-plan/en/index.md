# Little Ant's Big Plan

![Little Ant wears glasses and sits on top of a book. The other ants hold items of food.]({{ site.image-set }}/01.jpg)

Little Ant loved to read. Little Ant was often teased.

“Ants don’t read. Ants must feed. Ants collect the food they need.”

![A boy lies on a picnic blanket reading a book. The ants carry away his picnic food.]({{ site.image-set }}/02.jpg)

Little Ant would read all day, he’d read and read the day away. 

The other ants took what they found to store for winter underground.

![Inside his ant heap, Little Ant's Mum and Dad scold him about reading books all the time. His little sister watches with interest.]({{ site.image-set }}/03.jpg)

His mum and dad got really mad, and Little Ant felt really bad.

![The trees are bare and autum leaves are all around. The ants look under the leaves and collect a discarded apple core. ]({{ site.image-set }}/04.jpg)

In autumn when the leaves fall down, the ants must keep food underground.

![The Queen addresses the ants.]({{ site.image-set }}/05.jpg)

The Queen wants food to fill the store, so all the ants must work some more.

![Little Ant's thought bubble shows a hamburger and a restaurant table.]({{ site.image-set }}/06.jpg)

Little Ant begins to shout about a place he read about.

“A restaurant is what we need, a place where people go to feed. 

It says so in the books I read.”

![The ants march through the day and into the night.]({{ site.image-set }}/07.jpg)

The ants go marching one by one. 

They march into the setting sun.

![Little Ant reaches a burger restaurant with tables inside and out.]({{ site.image-set }}/08.jpg)

And Little Ant said “Hey, there’s one!”

![The ants carry hot dogs, burgers and chicken drumsticks through the day and into the night.]({{ site.image-set }}/09.jpg)

The ants go marching one by one, carrying a burger, carrying a bun.

![The Queen shakes Little Ant's hand. The rest of the ants cheer.]({{ site.image-set }}/10.jpg)

When they return the Queen is glad.

The stores are full. They cheer like mad.

![Inside his ant heap, Little Ant's Mum and Dad hug Little Ant. His little sister beams happily.]({{ site.image-set }}/11.jpg)

Ant gets hugs from mum and dad.

![The boy is reading a book. Little Ant and his little sister hold hands on top of the boy's shoulder. ]({{ site.image-set }}/12.jpg)

His baby sister takes his hand “Now I think I understand.”

“The way you love to read a book ... Makes me want to take a look.”
