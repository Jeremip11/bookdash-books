# Sbu’s Special Shoes

![Sbu tries on a pair of big red takkies. A chicken sits next to him.]({{ site.image-set }}/01.jpg)

These are my big brother Sbu’s shoes.

Look what I can do in them.

I can race cars!

Sometimes, I even race our bouncy dog.

With Sbu’s shoes I win every time.

![Sbu and the chicken put their hand out - wait!]({{ site.image-set }}/06.jpg)

Wait! 

Let me show you one more thing.

![Sbu and the chicken dance.]({{ site.image-set }}/07.jpg)

Watch me dance and spin.

![Sbu and the chicken do cartwheels.]({{ site.image-set }}/08.jpg)

I can cartwheel over and over.

![Sbu hangs upside down from a tree branch. The chicken watches.]({{ site.image-set }}/09.jpg)

I’m a monkey! Look at me hang upside down.

![Sbu leaps over the houses. The chicken watches from a roof.]({{ site.image-set }}/10.jpg)

Watch me jump and catch the moon.

![Sbu holds the shoes in his hands.]({{ site.image-set }}/11.jpg)

Here, try them on!
