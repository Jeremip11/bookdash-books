# Lory Dory 

![A little girl lies in bed. Her grandpa sits next to her. ]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

One night Grandpa was tucking me in.

His hands were soft and his hair was thin.

![Grandpa talks to the girl.]({{ page.images-folder }}/02.jpg)

‘I’m going to tell you a special story, about a girl named Lory Dory.’

![There is an empty armchair. Two eyes peek out. This is Lory Dory.]({{ page.images-folder }}/03.jpg)

You couldn’t see Lory Dory at all because she was born invisible.

![The falling rain makes an outline of Lory Dory. There is an outline of Lory Dory underneath the blankets on a bed. ]({{ page.images-folder }}/04.jpg)

You’d only see Lory when rain hit her head, or when she was curled under blankets in bed.

![Children are playing in the snow and pointing at the outline of Lory Dory made by the snow.]({{ page.images-folder }}/05.jpg)

Lory was left out of all the kids’ games. They teased her and they called her names.

‘Look, it’s Lory. The Imaginary Friend! She’s not like us, she’s just pretend!’

![A boy sits at his school desk. Lory Dory sits next to him and draws.]({{ page.images-folder }}/06.jpg)

One day at school, a boy wanted to know:

‘How do you look? I only see you in snow.’

![The boy hands Lory Dory a paint brush.]({{ page.images-folder }}/07.jpg)

‘Can you paint yourself?’ Lory knew that she could.

But not in the same way the boy thought she would.

![The picture is filled with paintings of cats and fruit and stars.]({{ page.images-folder }}/08.jpg)

Lory painted her body with all that she loved from the world all around and the sky up above.

![The paint makes footprints on the page.]({{ page.images-folder }}/09.jpg)

She painted herself every day with such pride, to bring out the person who she was inside.

![There is a painting of Lory Dory standing by the trees wearing a beautiful dress and smiling happily. ]({{ page.images-folder }}/10.jpg)

I know I’m invisible and hard to see. 

So I painted these pictures to show the real me.’

![Grandpa stands by the little girl's bed. ]({{ page.images-folder }}/11.jpg)

‘Are you making this up, Gramps? Is this story true?’

‘Lory is real – real as me, real as you.’

![The little girl lies in bed alone. Coloured light twinkles through the open door.]({{ page.images-folder }}/12.jpg)

When Grandpa had left me, I can’t quite be sure, but I think I saw Lory just outside my door.
