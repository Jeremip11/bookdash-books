# Tortoise finds his home

![Tortoise passes Snail in the veld.]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

One day Tortoise was walking through the veld. 

He was searching and searching. He gazed into the distance and squinted at the grass.

Then he went past snail. 

“Are you looking for something?” Snail asked.

“Yes, I’m looking for my house. Have you seen it, by any chance?”

![Snail travels on Tortoise's back.]({{ page.images-folder }}/02.jpg)

Snail said: “No, I haven’t, but I’ll help you look!”

She climbed onto Tortoise’s shell. Tortoise walked on with Snail on his back. They looked and looked, but there was no sign of a house. The sun was high in the sky.

A little later they passed Sparrow. 

“Are you looking for something?” asked Sparrow.

“Yes, I'm looking for my house. Have you seen it, by any chance?”

Sparrow said: “No, I haven’t, but I’ll help you look!”

![Snail sits on Tortoise's back. Sparrow flies ahead of them. There is a ladybird on a dandelion in the distance.]({{ page.images-folder }}/04.jpg)

He flapped his wings and he whizzed away.

“You’re going too fast for me!” complained Tortoise.

Sparrow came back. “Alright, then I’ll hop on too.”

Tortoise carried on with Snail and Sparrow perched on his shell. They looked and looked, but there was no sign of a house. teh sun had inched lower in the sky.

![Ladybird sits on a dandelion stem. Tortoise, Snail and Sparrow pass him.]({{ page.images-folder }}/05.jpg)

 A little later they passed Ladybird.

“Are you looking for something?” asked Ladybird.

“Yes, we’re looking for Tortoise’s house. Have you seen it, by any chance?”

![Snail, Sparrow and Ladybird travel on Snail's back.]({{ page.images-folder }}/06.jpg)

Laybird said: “No, I haven’t, but I’ll help you look!”

She hopped onto Tortoise’s back and on he went with Snail and Sparrow and Ladybird sitting on his back.

They looked and looked, but there was no sign of a house. 

A breeze started to blow.

![The animals find Mouse. He is making a daisy chain.]({{ page.images-folder }}/07.jpg)

A little later they passed Mouse. He was making a garland of daisies.

“Are you looking for something?” asked Mouse.

“Yes, Mouse, I’m looking for my house. Have you seen it, by any chance?”


![Mouse climbs on Tortoise's back with the others. The wind blows the leaves and the daisy chain.]({{ page.images-folder }}/08.jpg)

Mouse said: “No, I haven’t, but I’ll help you look!”

He hopped onto Tortoise’s back. Wait I can't leave my flowers behind. Tortoise waited. Mouse stretched and stretched and scooped up his daisies.

Tortoise walked on with Snail and Sparrow and Ladybird and Mouse on his back. They looked and looked, but there was no sign of a house. 

The wind swept the leaves off the ground and swirled them around Tortoise.

Tortoise got tired. "You lot are heavy," he sighed.

![Tortoise walks with Mouse, Snail, Sparrow and Ladybird on his back.]({{ page.images-folder }}/09.jpg)

The wind got stronger and stronger. The sky turned dark.

“Oh, where is my house?” asked Tortoise.

Thunder roared in the hills. Lightning flashed in the distance. Drip-drip came the rain.

“Oh, where is Tortoise’s house?” asked Snail and Sparrow and Ladybird and Mouse.

![The wind gets stronger. The rain threatens. The animals all fly off Tortoise's back.]({{ page.images-folder }}/10.jpg)

The wind whirled and whipped and blew Snail and Sparrow and Ladybird and Mouse right off Tortoise’s back.

![The hail comes down. Tortoise curls up in his shell. The other animals stand nearby.]({{ page.images-folder }}/11.jpg)

And then came the hail, tip-tip-tip. Tortoise got such a fright he shrank into his shell. It was warm and cosy there.

“Oh, here is my house!” he said.

![Mouse, Ladybird, Snail and Sparrow take shelter underneath Tortoise's shell.]({{ page.images-folder }}/12.jpg)

“Oh, here is Tortoise’s house!”
