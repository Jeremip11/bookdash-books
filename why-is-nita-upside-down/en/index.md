# Why Is Nita Upside Down?

![]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

Nita’s hanging upside down, her long hair tickling at the ground.

The trees, the grass, the everything is all the wrong way round.

Her feet, they poke into the sky. Little Navi’s walking by.

He says ‘I’ve seen you here before. You’re upside down again! What for?’

His feet swim lightly in the air. She tries to hide behind her hair.

‘It’s h-h-h-hard to t-t-talk’, she says to him. ‘I’m not the same. I don’t fit in.

Navi takes her by the hand. He wants to help her understand.

They climb to Navi’s look-out spot. From up here they can see a lot.

They perch and have a quiet stare at children playing here and there.

Those kids are not the same at all. 

Abe’s round.

Lala’s extra tall.

Bambam’s wild and must be free,

Look at Freya's crazy hair.

And Sid wears glasses everywhere.

And me, I am just skin and bone.

And you are you. You’re not alone.

Each human’s sort of strange, you see. That makes you just the same, like me.

This world is really one big game. To play, we can’t all be the same.
