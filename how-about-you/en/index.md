# How about you?

![A girl wearing dungarees and a cap and a boy wearing a tutu and playing a guitar stand in a puddle.]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

Who are you?

![A monster dripping goo looks in their direction.]({{ page.images-folder }}/02.jpg)

Is that goo?

Eeuw!

I want some too.

![A block with the number 2 stands in the puddle. The number 632 is written in goo.]({{ page.images-folder }}/03.jpg)

We are two. 

How old are you?

Six hundred and thirty two?

![The girl wears blue. The boy wears red shoes.]({{ page.images-folder }}/04.jpg)

I like blue. Do you too?

I choose two shoes. 

Which do you choose? 

![The monster has horseshoes for eyes.]({{ page.images-folder }}/05.jpg)

Horseshoes!?

![A ball, a toy car and some marbles lie in a puddle.]({{ page.images-folder }}/06.jpg)

I make toys with boys.

![The boy and the monster shout.]({{ page.images-folder }}/07.jpg)

We make lots of noise.

Whaaa!

eurgghhh...aargh!


![The girl sleeps on a woman's back.]({{ page.images-folder }}/08.jpg)

I take a nap on Gogo’s back.

![The boy sits in the puddle, wide awake.]({{ page.images-folder }}/09.jpg)

I don’t nap!

![The moon and the sun shine.]({{ page.images-folder }}/10.jpg)

I stay upright all through the night.

![Someone kicks a ball into the monster's goo.]({{ page.images-folder }}/11.jpg)

The ball goes THWOCK! Buddy, you ROCK!

![The monster and the children hold hands. ]({{ page.images-folder }}/12.jpg)

That’s what we do. How about you?
