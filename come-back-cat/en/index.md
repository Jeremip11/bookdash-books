# Come back, cat!

![Cat hides under the couch.]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

Come back, cat! Play with me.

![Cat leaps up and hangs off the curtains.]({{ page.images-folder }}/02.jpg)

Sit in your basket. Stay right here!

![Cat sits in her basket. She is grumpy.]({{ page.images-folder }}/03.jpg)

Come back, cat! That’s way too high.

![Cat sneaks out the back door.]({{ page.images-folder }}/04.jpg)

Come back, cat! Don’t go outside.

![Cat runs outside and chases butterflies.]({{ page.images-folder }}/05.jpg)


![Cat pulls a sock off the washline and unravels the thread.]({{ page.images-folder }}/06.jpg)

Come back, cat! That’s not yours.

![Cat finds a snail in the dirt. The sock thread is wound around her tail.]({{ page.images-folder }}/07.jpg)

Come back, cat! What have you got?

![Cat encounters a chicken. Cat now has thread around her tail and the snail on her back.]({{ page.images-folder }}/08.jpg)

Come back, cat. 

That’s not your friend!

![Chicken feathers float around Cat's head. She still has the thread around her tail and the snail on her back.]({{ page.images-folder }}/09.jpg)

Hello, cat! Are you back?

![Cat lies in her basket looking satisfied.]({{ page.images-folder }}/10.jpg)

Stay in your basket. It’s nap time now.

![Cat's basket is empty except for a few feathers.]({{ page.images-folder }}/11.jpg)

Cat?

![Cat sleeps peacefully on the couch with the feathers, thread and snail. ]({{ page.images-folder }}/12.jpg)
