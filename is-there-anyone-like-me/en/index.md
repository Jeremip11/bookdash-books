# Is There Anyone Like Me?

![Donkey lies on the grass and wonders to herself.]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

I wonder if there’s another me somewhere in the world.

![She leans over the river bank and gazes at herself in the water. She brays loudly across the cliffs.]({{ page.images-folder }}/02.jpg)

Who looks the same.

And talks the same.

![Donkey stands next to Hippo and Mouse and they compare their curly tails. ]({{ page.images-folder }}/03.jpg)

And even has my curls.

![Donkey looks up at her pointy ears with her big green eyes. Donkey laughs.]({{ page.images-folder }}/04.jpg)

Someone with my eyes my ears. 

Who even has my laugh.

![Donkey and Hyena jump over the rocks.]({{ page.images-folder }}/05.jpg)

Who can do what I can do ...

![Monkey peels a banana. Donkey and Guinea Fowl look at the banana. They are confused.]({{ page.images-folder }}/06.jpg)

... and can’t do what I can’t.

![Donkey is at the park. She peers around a tree.]({{ page.images-folder }}/07.jpg)

I’ve looked and looked everywhere to find another me.

I went down to the park and looked behind the trees.

![Donkey looks closely at Bird in her nest and Mouse in his hole.]({{ page.images-folder }}/08.jpg)

I looked around, up and down ...

![Donkey examines Buffalo, Giraffe and Elephant across the watering hole.]({{ page.images-folder }}/09.jpg)

... at every single face.

![Donkey looks at her own shadow.]({{ page.images-folder }}/10.jpg)

I couldn’t find another me in any single place.

![Donkey smiles and all the other animals smile too.]({{ page.images-folder }}/11.jpg)

There’s only one me in the world!

I’m special, oh it’s true!

![Donkey winks.]({{ page.images-folder }}/12.jpg)

But not just me, don’t you see?

There’s only one of you!
