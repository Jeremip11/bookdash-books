# Who is our friend?

![Crocodile, Zebra, Giraffe and Rhino stand together. ]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

Can you guess who our best friend is?

**He’s not like us at all.**

![Bird sits alone.]({{ page.images-folder }}/02.jpg)

Our best friend is **Bird!**

![Rhino snorts angrily at the flies buzzing around his tail.]({{ page.images-folder }}/03.jpg)

I am Rhino. 

**I get covered in fleas.**

![Bird sits on Rhino's back with a fly in his beak. Rhino is happy.]({{ page.images-folder }}/04.jpg)

Bird eats them all up.

![Crocodile opens his mouth to show his rows of teeth.]({{ page.images-folder }}/05.jpg)

I am Crocodile. 

**I can’t brush my teeth.**

![Bird sits in Crocodile's mouth and pecks at his teeth.]({{ page.images-folder }}/06.jpg)

Bird pecks them all clean.

![Giraffe tries to curl his tongue out behind him. ]({{ page.images-folder }}/07.jpg)

I am Giraffe. 

**I can’t scratch my head.**

![Bird perches on Giraffe's neck and holds a small twig.]({{ page.images-folder }}/08.jpg)

Bird can reach just the right spot.

![Zebra stands in the tall grass and squints.]({{ page.images-folder }}/09.jpg)

I am Zebra.

**I can’t see things far away.**

![Bird sits on Zebra's head and looks out into the distance. Zebra is happy.]({{ page.images-folder }}/10.jpg)

Bird has great eyes, 

**so when he’s watching I’m safe.**

![The animals stand together. Only their legs are visible. Bird is on the ground.]({{ page.images-folder }}/11.jpg)

Bird might be different, but that’s no problem...

![Bird sings loudly. The animals watch.]({{ page.images-folder }}/12.jpg)

We don’t even mind when he sings!

Will you be my friend?
