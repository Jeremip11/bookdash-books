# How about you?

![A girl wearing dungarees and a cap and a boy wearing a tutu and playing a guitar stand in a puddle.]({{ site.image-set }}/01.jpg)

Who are you?

![A monster dripping goo looks in their direction.]({{ site.image-set }}/02.jpg)

Is that goo?

Eeuw!

I want some too.

![A block with the number 2 stands in the puddle. The number 632 is written in goo.]({{ site.image-set }}/03.jpg)

We are two. 

How old are you?

Six hundred and thirty two?

![The girl wears blue. The boy wears red shoes.]({{ site.image-set }}/04.jpg)

I like blue. Do you too?

I choose two shoes. 

Which do you choose? 

![The monster has horseshoes for eyes.]({{ site.image-set }}/05.jpg)

Horseshoes!?

![A ball, a toy car and some marbles lie in a puddle.]({{ site.image-set }}/06.jpg)

I make toys with boys.

![The boy and the monster shout.]({{ site.image-set }}/07.jpg)

We make lots of noise.

Whaaa!

eurgghhh...aargh!


![The girl sleeps on a woman's back.]({{ site.image-set }}/08.jpg)

I take a nap on Gogo’s back.

![The boy sits in the puddle, wide awake.]({{ site.image-set }}/09.jpg)

I don’t nap!

![The moon and the sun shine.]({{ site.image-set }}/10.jpg)

I stay upright all through the night.

![Someone kicks a ball into the monster's goo.]({{ site.image-set }}/11.jpg)

The ball goes THWOCK! Buddy, you ROCK!

![The monster and the children hold hands. ]({{ site.image-set }}/12.jpg)

That’s what we do. How about you?
