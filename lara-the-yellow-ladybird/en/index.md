# Lara the Yellow Ladybird

![Lara sits on a flower. She watches the other ladybirds. They all have red wings. Her's are yellow.]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

Lara the ladybird was a special bug.

Unlike all her friends, she had bright yellow wings.

![Lara's mother sends her off to school. On her way she waves to Manto Mantis and Bibi Butterfly.]({{ page.images-folder }}/02.jpg)

Everyone loved her yellow wings. 

Each morning, Bibi Butterfly said hello.

And Manto Mantis always waved.

![Sesa Spider hangs from her nest. Lara arrives at school. Her friends are happy to see her.]({{ page.images-folder }}/03.jpg)

Even Sesa, the sulky spider, was happy to see her. 

At school, she played with lots of friends.

![At home, Lara cries to her mother. She dreams of red wings.]({{ page.images-folder }}/04.jpg)

But Lara wanted to be like the other ladybirds. 

“I wish I had red wings like you, Mama,” she cried.

![Lara stands on a chair in front of the mirror. Her mother paints are yellow wings using a tin of red paint.]({{ page.images-folder }}/05.jpg)

So one day, to cheer her up, Lara’s mother painted her wings bright red.

![On the way to school, Lara waves to the other insects. They don't wave back.]({{ page.images-folder }}/06.jpg)

The next morning, nobody greeted Lara on her way to school.

![Lara arrives at school. Her friends don't greet her.]({{ page.images-folder }}/07.jpg)

And when she got there, none of her friends said hello.

![Lara sits alone. She cries to her teacher.]({{ page.images-folder }}/08.jpg)

Lara sat all alone. No one noticed her new red wings.

Until Miss Miya spotted her and said: “You’ve painted your lovely yellow wings!”

![Miss Miya tells the children what Lara has done. They are shocked.]({{ page.images-folder }}/09.jpg)

Lara’s classmates were shocked. 

“Your wings are special!”

“So unique!”“So rare!”

![Miss Miya tells Lara about Sipho's large spot and Sally's long legs.]({{ page.images-folder }}/10.jpg)

“Lara,” Miss Miya said, “your yellow wings are what make you you.

Like Sipho’s spot ... and Sally’s legs.”

![Lara lies in the bath and scrubs the red paint off her wings. Her wings are yellow again.]({{ page.images-folder }}/11.jpg)

Back home, Lara took a long bath and scrubbed until her golden wings gleamed.

“I’ll never paint my wings again!” she thought. 

Except, maybe once or twice ...

![Lara holds a paintbrush. Her wings are painted with colourful dots and stars and stripes.]({{ page.images-folder }}/12.jpg)

To try a bit of purple ... or something nice.

But not for ever and just for fun.
