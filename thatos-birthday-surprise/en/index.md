# Thato’s Birthday Surprise

![Thato points to the calendar on his bedroom wall.]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

It is one week until Thato’s birthday.

That’s seven whole days!

![Thato eats his breakfast. Mama says he will get a big surprise for his birthday.]({{ page.images-folder }}/02.jpg)

His mama says: “Your birthday present will be a BIG surprise!”

Thato wonders: what will it be?

![Thato flies in the sky. He has wings strapped to his arms.]({{ page.images-folder }}/03.jpg)

On Monday Thato thinks:

Maybe I will get giant wings so I can fly high in the sky like a bird...”

![The house next door is a giant cake!]({{ page.images-folder }}/04.jpg)

On Tuesday Thato thinks:

“Maybe I will have a birthday cake as big as a house!”

![Thato flies in a rocket through space.]({{ page.images-folder }}/05.jpg)

On Wednesday Thato thinks:

“Maybe I will get a rocket ship to whizz up to the moon.

![Thato wears goggles and flippers. He swims under the ocean. ]({{ page.images-folder }}/06.jpg)

On Thursday Thato thinks:

“Maybe I will get fins so I can swim under the water like a fish.”

![Thato is on a soccer field. He holds a trophy high in the air.]({{ page.images-folder }}/07.jpg)

On Friday Thato thinks:

“Maybe I will get magic soccer boots and score a thousand goals!”

![Thato wears a crown. He opens a box which sparkles with jewels.]({{ page.images-folder }}/08.jpg)

On Saturday Thato thinks:

“Maybe I will get a key that opens a box filled with treasure!”

![Mama opens the door for Thato.]({{ page.images-folder }}/09.jpg)

On Sunday it is Thato’s birthday.

Mama smiles and says: “Come and see your surprise!”

![Thato's brother gets out of a taxi. He carries his luggage.]({{ page.images-folder }}/10.jpg)

It is the best present ever.

Thato’s big brother Kudzai has come to visit all the way from the big city!

![Thato's brother picks Thato up and hugs him.]({{ page.images-folder }}/11.jpg)

Thato smiles and smiles and his big brother lifts him up in the air and hugs him.

Kudzai asks:“What do you want to do for your birthday, little brother?”

![Thato thinks of his wings, his cake, flying through space, swimming, playing soccer and hunting for treasure.]({{ page.images-folder }}/12.jpg)

And Thato knows exactly what they will do the whole day long.
