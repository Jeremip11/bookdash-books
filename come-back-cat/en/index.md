# Come back, cat!

![Cat hides under the couch.]({{ site.image-set }}/01.jpg)

Come back, cat! Play with me.

![Cat leaps up and hangs off the curtains.]({{ site.image-set }}/02.jpg)

Sit in your basket. Stay right here!

![Cat sits in her basket. She is grumpy.]({{ site.image-set }}/03.jpg)

Come back, cat! That’s way too high.

![Cat sneaks out the back door.]({{ site.image-set }}/04.jpg)

Come back, cat! Don’t go outside.

![Cat runs outside and chases butterflies.]({{ site.image-set }}/05.jpg)


![Cat pulls a sock off the washline and unravels the thread.]({{ site.image-set }}/06.jpg)

Come back, cat! That’s not yours.

![Cat finds a snail in the dirt. The sock thread is wound around her tail.]({{ site.image-set }}/07.jpg)

Come back, cat! What have you got?

![Cat encounters a chicken. Cat now has thread around her tail and the snail on her back.]({{ site.image-set }}/08.jpg)

Come back, cat. 

That’s not your friend!

![Chicken feathers float around Cat's head. She still has the thread around her tail and the snail on her back.]({{ site.image-set }}/09.jpg)

Hello, cat! Are you back?

![Cat lies in her basket looking satisfied.]({{ site.image-set }}/10.jpg)

Stay in your basket. It’s nap time now.

![Cat's basket is empty except for a few feathers.]({{ site.image-set }}/11.jpg)

Cat?

![Cat sleeps peacefully on the couch with the feathers, thread and snail. ]({{ site.image-set }}/12.jpg)
