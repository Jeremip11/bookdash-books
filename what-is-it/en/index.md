# What is it?

![A group of strange-looking animals spot a grey blob in the distance.]({{ site.image-set }}/01.jpg)

What is it?

![The animal that looks like a mixture of a crocodile and an elephant asks: "What is it?"]({{ site.image-set }}/02.jpg)

What is it? It hasn't got a trunk. It's not like me.

![The animal that looks like a mixture of a monkey and a rat asks: "What is it?"]({{ site.image-set }}/03.jpg)

What is it? It hasn’t got a tail. It’s not like me.

![The animal that looks like a mixture of an owl and a sheep asks: "What is it?"]({{ site.image-set }}/04.jpg)

What is it? Ugh! Where are its feathers? It’s not like me.

![A mother and baby buck with claws ask: "What is it?"]({{ site.image-set }}/05.jpg)

What is it? Look at those tiny feet. It’s not like us.

![The crocodile-elephant asks: "Do you think it's dangerous?"]({{ site.image-set }}/06.jpg)

Do you think it’s dangerous?

![The monkey-rat asks: "Do you think it wants to eat us?"]({{ site.image-set }}/07.jpg)

Do you think it wants to eat us?

![The grey blob sneezes.]({{ site.image-set }}/08.jpg)

Achoo! Achoo!

![All of the animals open their eyes wide in fear.]({{ site.image-set }}/09.jpg)

Aargh! Eek! Run!

![The animals run away. A  baby human crawls towards them. The grey blob is her shadow.]({{ site.image-set }}/10.jpg)

It's chasing us!

![The baby buck walks towards the baby human.]({{ site.image-set }}/11.jpg)

Be careful. Come back.

![The baby buck and the baby human rub their noses together in greeting.]({{ site.image-set }}/12.jpg)

What is it? 

It's a baby, just like me!
