# The best thing ever

![Muzi looks at the impressive tower he has made with wooden blocks.]({{ site.image-set }}/01.jpg)

Muzi loves to build things.

He dreams of building the best thing ever.

![Muzi has built a shelter for his toys. It is a blanket tied to a door handle. His mother opens the door. The shelter falls apart.]({{ site.image-set }}/02.jpg)

Once he built a shelter for his toys.

But it wasn’t the best thing ever.

![Muzi builds a bridge with his blocks. One part falls down under the weight of his toy animals.]({{ site.image-set }}/03.jpg)

Yesterday he built a bridge for his animals. 

It was a good thing. But not the best...

![Muzi closes the door to his bedroom where all his toys are packed away. He carries a backpack.]({{ site.image-set }}/04.jpg)

Today Muzi is going to visit uGogo.

He is sad. Without his toys, how can he build the best thing ever?

![Muzi and his mother stand at the bus stop. They point to a man and his overflowing trolley of recyclable objects.]({{ site.image-set }}/05.jpg)

At the bus stop, Muzi is amazed. 

He sees red things and blue things.

Small things and big things.

New things and old things.

![Muzi sits on his mother's lap inside the bus. He sees clouds in the shape of a house.]({{ site.image-set }}/06.jpg)

Muzi has a new idea for building the best thing ever.

![Muzi kneels down and picks up objects in the road: bottle tops and cans and ice cream sticks...]({{ site.image-set }}/07.jpg)

On the road to uGogo’s, Muzi finds many things.

Long things and short things.

Round things and square things.

![Muzi stands by the river. He notices leaves and twigs and stones.]({{ site.image-set }}/08.jpg)

By the riverside, Muzi finds more things. 

Soft things and pointy things. 

Green things and brown things.

![Muzi and his mother arrive at Gogo's shack. They carry shopping bags filled with Muzi's found objects.]({{ site.image-set }}/09.jpg)

Look, Muzi! We are here.

![Muzi's mother and Gogo bake bread. Muzi builds in the corner using dough and his newfound things.]({{ site.image-set }}/10.jpg)

While uGogo bakes for the hungry travellers... 

Muzi builds.

![Muzi presents his sculpture to Gogo. It is a house made from dough and all his found objects.]({{ site.image-set }}/11.jpg)

Look Gogo, a new house for you. 

Oh, Muzi, laughs Gogo. 

This is the best thing ever!

![The house is a beautiful mix of colours and textures using bottle tops, sticks, matchboxes and more.]({{ site.image-set }}/12.jpg)

Gogo, Gogo! says Muzi. The world is full of toys. Look what I can build.
