# Whose button is this?

![Tinny Tim is a toy robot. A blue button bounces up to him.]({{ site.image-set }}/01.jpg)

Tinny Tim was sitting on the road when a button bounced his way.

![Tinny Tim carries the button. He walks with determination.]({{ site.image-set }}/02.jpg)

“I wonder where this comes from,” he said. 

He wanted to find out.

![Tinny Tim almost gets squashed under someone's red shoe.]({{ site.image-set }}/03.jpg)

It was busy on the side of the road.

“Woah!”

He nearly got squashed.

![Tinny Tim holds onto the shoe lace. He swings through the air.]({{ site.image-set }}/04.jpg)

He made a lucky escape.

“It’s scary out here,” he said.

![Tinny Tim looks up to the green man on the traffic light.]({{ site.image-set }}/05.jpg)

“Hey there, is this yours?”

![The green man changes to a red man.]({{ site.image-set }}/06.jpg)

The green man said nothing. He just turned red.

“What a rude person.”

![Tinny Tim sees a dog in the distance.]({{ site.image-set }}/07.jpg)

Tinny Tim carried on looking.

“Whose button is this?”

![The dog licks Tinny Tim. He gets covered in dog drool.]({{ site.image-set }}/08.jpg)

“Woah..!

...at least he’s friendly.”

![Tinny Tim holds the button. He stands at a pedestrian crossing.]({{ site.image-set }}/09.jpg)

“I’ve got to get to the other side. 

I’m sure that’s where this comes from.”

![A car drives through a puddle and he gets splashed.]({{ site.image-set }}/10.jpg)

SPLASH!

“That was close.”

He waited for the cars to pass before he carried on.

![Tinny Tim holds the button in the air.]({{ site.image-set }}/11.jpg)

Maybe this was who he was looking for.

“Hello, who are you?”

![Ruby Rags is a doll with buttons for eyes. She is missing one eye.]({{ site.image-set }}/12.jpg)

“I’m Ruby Rags.” “I think this is yours,”he said.

![Ruby Rags and Tinny Tim sit next to each other. Ruby has both eyes!]({{ site.image-set }}/13.jpg)

“Thank you, little robot. Can we be friends?”
