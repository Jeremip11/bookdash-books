# Grandpa's Gold

![Elephant, Giraffe, Mountain Goat, Cheetah and Monkey are discussing their grandpas.]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

The children were talking about their Grandpas.

![Grandpa Giraffe builds a tower of bricks that touches the clouds.]({{ page.images-folder }}/02.jpg)

My Grandpa can build a tower to the sky, said Giraffe. 

Once he built a skyscraper for a king.

![Grandpa Cheetah holds a fishing rod. He stands next to a whale in a bath.]({{ page.images-folder }}/03.jpg)

My Grandpa can fish for anything in the sea, said Cheetah. 

Once he caught a whale and kept it in his bath.

![Grandpa Mountain Goat proudly stands at the peak of a mountain.]({{ page.images-folder }}/04.jpg)

My Grandpa can climb to the clouds in the sky, said Mountain Goat.

He climbed the tallest mountain in the world, in just four hours.

![Grandpa Elephant wears a chef's cap. He holds a plate of jelly, a whisk, a tea towel and a tower of cakes. Colourful balloons float all around him.]({{ page.images-folder }}/05.jpg)

My Grandpa can cook a feast, said Elephant.

Once he cooked a meal for a president’s birthday party. All by himself.

![Monkey points to his teeth and tells his friends about his Grandpa.]({{ page.images-folder }}/06.jpg)

Well my Grandpa doesn’t build or fish or climb or cook, said Monkey. But he owns gold!

He hides it in his mouth. And at night he soaks it in a glass of water.

![The animals fight.]({{ page.images-folder }}/07.jpg)

No, he doesn’t! Yes, he does! No, he doesn’t!

Well, come and see if you don’t believe me, said Monkey.

![The children follow Monkey to go and find his Grandpa.]({{ page.images-folder }}/08.jpg)

So the children went to see Monkey’s Grandpa.

![Monkey's Grandpa sits in an armchair. Some of his teeth are gold.]({{ page.images-folder }}/09.jpg)

You see? said Monkey. And he can take them out.

![The childen crowd around Grandpa Monkey.]({{ page.images-folder }}/10.jpg)

No, he can’t! cried the animals.

![Grandpa, tongue hanging out his mouth, holds his false teeth up in the air.]({{ page.images-folder }}/11.jpg)

Waaah! said Grandpa Monkey. And there are enough ...

![The children all smile... with gold teeth in their mouths.]({{ page.images-folder }}/12.jpg)

... for everyone!
