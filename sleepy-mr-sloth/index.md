One day, Mr Sloth came  
to visit. He said:  
I’m sleepy! I need a good  
branch for a bed!

![Mr Sloth is sleepy and yawning](images/1.jpg)
{:.page-break-after}

I’m quite good at climbing.  
I know how to swing.  
But sleeping’s my favourite,  
favourite thing!

![Mr Sloth starts climbing the tree](images/2.jpg)
{:.page-break-after}

This branch looks lovely!  
I think I’ll sleep here.  
And you? Don’t you think  
that’s a splendid idea?

![Mr Sloth spots a branch. Is that a big ear nearby?](images/3.jpg)
{:.page-break-after}

Oh no, Mr Sloth! A giraffe’s  
eating there!  
He might think you’re lunch  
and start nibbling your hair!

![A giraffe bites Mr Sloth by mistake!](images/4.jpg)
{:.page-break-after}

This branch looks lovely!  
I think I’ll sleep here.  
And you? Don’t you think  
that’s a splendid idea?

![Mr Sloth spots a branch. There are a few bees flying around.](images/5.jpg)
{:.page-break-after}

Oh no, Mr Sloth! There’s  
a beehive right there!  
You’ll never get sleep with  
those bees everywhere!

This branch looks lovely!  
I think I’ll sleep here.  
And you? Don’t you think  
that’s a splendid idea?

![Mr Sloth spots a branch. There is a tail nearby.](images/7.jpg)
{:.page-break-after}

Oh no, Mr Sloth, that’s  
a snake over there!  
Not a branch! Poor old snake.  
You gave him quite a scare.

![Mr Sloth grabs snake by mistake!](images/8.jpg)
{:.page-break-after}

This branch looks lovely!  
I think I’ll sleep here.  
And you? Don’t you think  
that’s a splendid idea?\

![Mr Sloth spots and branch. There are feet nearby.](images/9.jpg)
{:.page-break-after}

Oh no, Mr Sloth! There’s  
a bird squawking there!  
You’ll never get sleep with that  
noise in the air!

![A hadeda is squawking loudly there!](images/10.jpg)
{:.page-break-after}

Try climb one more branch,  
Mr Sloth! they all said.  
And that branch was just the  
right one for his bed.

![Mr Sloth climbs to the top of the tree and smiles.](images/11.jpg)
{:.page-break-after}

The bird and the snake,  
the giraffe and each bee  
were happy to have Mr Sloth  
in their tree.
