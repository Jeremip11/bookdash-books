# Shongololo’s Shoes

![Shongololo only sees four of his yellow gumboots on the floor.]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

Where are all my shoes?

I know I left them here!

![It is raining and Hedgehog holds up an umbrella made from one of Shongololo's yellow gumboots.]({{ page.images-folder }}/02.jpg)

I haven’t seen your shoes.

Go ask Snail!

![Snail sits on top of a mushroom. His new shell is a bright yellow gumboot!]({{ page.images-folder }}/03.jpg)

No shoes here.

Go ask Giraffe.

![Giraffe is cycling on a bright pink bicycle. He is using one of Shongololo's shoes as a helmet.]({{ page.images-folder }}/04.jpg)

I’m in a hurry – go ask Frog.

![Frog is floating down the river in one of Shongololo's shoes.]({{ page.images-folder }}/05.jpg)

Shoes? How many?

Go ask Flamingo.

![Flamingo is dancing in a puddle. She is wearing two of Shongololo's shoes as earrings.]({{ page.images-folder }}/06.jpg)

Seen your shoes?

No, not me.

![Shongololo lies down in despair and starts to cry.]({{ page.images-folder }}/07.jpg)

Will I ever find my shoes?

![Fox stands under a tree drinking tea out of a yellow shoe.]({{ page.images-folder }}/08.jpg)

Shoes, eh? You should ask the Monkeys

![The monkeys are in the tree playing tin can telephone with two of Shongololo' shoes.]({{ page.images-folder }}/09.jpg)

We’re busy. Go ask Owl, she knows everything!

Hello hello?

![Owl sits on a branch and reads a book. A yellow gumboot filled with pens and pencils sits on the branch beside her.]({{ page.images-folder }}/10.jpg)

Hmm. I have an idea. Why don’t you ask Lion?

![Lion is preening himself in front of the mirror. His mane is arranged in tight curls held in place by nine of Shongololo's gumboots.]({{ page.images-folder }}/11.jpg) 

These are yours? I’ll give them all back if you come to my party!

![All of the animals enjoy a party under the stars. Shongololo is finally wearing all of his shoes.]({{ page.images-folder }}/12.jpg)
