# Sleepy Mr Sloth

![Mr Sloth is sleepy and yawning.]({{ site.image-set }}/01.jpg)

One day, Mr Sloth came to visit. He said:

I’m sleepy! I need a good branch for a bed!

![Mr Sloth starts climbing the tree.]({{ site.image-set }}/02.jpg)

I’m quite good at climbing. I know how to swing.  

But sleeping’s my favourite, favourite thing!

![Mr Sloth spots a branch. Is that a big ear nearby?]({{ site.image-set }}/03.jpg)

This branch looks lovely! I think I’ll sleep here.  

And you? Don’t you think that’s a splendid idea?

![A giraffe bites Mr Sloth by mistake!]({{ site.image-set }}/04.jpg)

Oh no, Mr Sloth! A giraffe’s eating there!  

He might think you’re lunch and start nibbling your hair!

![Mr Sloth spots a branch. There are a few bees flying around.]({{ site.image-set }}/05.jpg)

This branch looks lovely! I think I’ll sleep here.  

And you? Don’t you think that’s a splendid idea?

![Bees fly out of a beehive around Mr Sloth!]({{ site.image-set }}/06.jpg)

Oh no, Mr Sloth! There’s a beehive right there!  

You’ll never get sleep with those bees everywhere!

![Mr Sloth spots a branch. There is a tail nearby.]({{ site.image-set }}/07.jpg)

This branch looks lovely! I think I’ll sleep here.  

And you? Don’t you think that’s a splendid idea?

![Mr Sloth grabs snake by mistake!]({{ site.image-set }}/08.jpg)

Oh no, Mr Sloth, that’s a snake over there!  

Not a branch! Poor old snake. You gave him quite a scare.

![Mr Sloth spots a branch. There are feet nearby.]({{ site.image-set }}/09.jpg)

This branch looks lovely! I think I’ll sleep here.  

And you? Don’t you think that’s a splendid idea?

![A hadeda is squawking loudly there!]({{ site.image-set }}/10.jpg)

Oh no, Mr Sloth! There’s a bird squawking there!  

You’ll never get sleep with that noise in the air!

![Mr Sloth climbs to the top of the tree and smiles.]({{ site.image-set }}/11.jpg)

Try climb one more branch, Mr Sloth! they all said.  

And that branch was just the right one for his bed.

![Mr Sloth and the animals are all sleeping nicely in the tree together.]({{ site.image-set }}/12.jpg)

The bird and the snake, the giraffe and each bee  

were happy to have Mr Sloth in their tree.
