# Whose button is this?

![Tinny Tim is a toy robot. A blue button bounces up to him.]({{ page.images-folder }}/01.jpg)

Tinny Tim was sitting on the road when a button bounced his way.

![Tinny Tim carries the button. He walks with determination.]({{ page.images-folder }}/02.jpg)

“I wonder where this comes from,” he said. 

He wanted to find out.

![Tinny Tim almost gets squashed under someone's red shoe.]({{ page.images-folder }}/03.jpg)

It was busy on the side of the road.

“Woah!”

He nearly got squashed.

![Tinny Tim holds onto the shoe lace. He swings through the air.]({{ page.images-folder }}/04.jpg)

He made a lucky escape.

“It’s scary out here,” he said.

![Tinny Tim looks up to the green man on the traffic light.]({{ page.images-folder }}/05.jpg)

“Hey there, is this yours?”

![The green man changes to a red man.]({{ page.images-folder }}/06.jpg)

The green man said nothing. He just turned red.

“What a rude person.”

![Tinny Tim sees a dog in the distance.]({{ page.images-folder }}/07.jpg)

Tinny Tim carried on looking.

“Whose button is this?”

![The dog licks Tinny Tim. He gets covered in dog drool.]({{ page.images-folder }}/08.jpg)

“Woah..!

...at least he’s friendly.”

![Tinny Tim holds the button. He stands at a pedestrian crossing.]({{ page.images-folder }}/09.jpg)

“I’ve got to get to the other side. 

I’m sure that’s where this comes from.”

![A car drives through a puddle and he gets splashed.]({{ page.images-folder }}/10.jpg)

SPLASH!

“That was close.”

He waited for the cars to pass before he carried on.

![Tinny Tim holds the button in the air.]({{ page.images-folder }}/11.jpg)

Maybe this was who he was looking for.

“Hello, who are you?”

![Ruby Rags is a doll with buttons for eyes. She is missing one eye.]({{ page.images-folder }}/12.jpg)

“I’m Ruby Rags.” “I think this is yours,”he said.

![Ruby Rags and Tinny Tim sit next to each other. Ruby has both eyes!]({{ page.images-folder }}/13.jpg)

“Thank you, little robot. Can we be friends?”
